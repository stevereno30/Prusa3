These STL files are calibrated for my exact machine! Don't use these unless your vitamins match those in the list below!
All metric bolts (except those for mounting the NEMA17 motors) have been replaced with ANSI machine screws (that is, the illogical and confusing standard measurements used in the USA)

*For simplicities sake, the only thread size used was #6 (6-32 machine screws/nuts).*

The following screws are needed to assemble this printer:
* 4x 2" screws (two for mounting the extruder, two for the extruder idler)
* 14x 1.25" screws (four for the headed bed, ten for the bearing mounts)
* 7x 1" screws (four for the belt tensioners, three for the endstop mounts)
* 6x 0.5" screws (for endstops)
* 11x 3mm x 10mm bolts for the motor mounts (six for the z-axis, three for the x-axis, and two for the y-axis)

You will also need the following misc hardware:
* 31x 6-32 nuts (one for each of the screws above)
* 2x m6 nuts (for the z-axis... I had to use m6 because I couldn't source m5 threaded rod)
* 1x m8 nylon lock nut (for the hobbed bolt)
* 2-5 washers that fit snug around your hobbed bolt(for adjusting the position of your hobbed bolt's hobs)
* 6x stiff springs (two for your extruder idler, four for your heated bed)
* 12x 6-32 compatible washers (to contain the springs on your heated bed and extruder idler)
* 34x 3/8 nuts (for the y-axis threaded rods, which is what I used for my printer since they are a fraction of the cost of M10 rods)
* 5x 608zz bearings (two for the extruder, one for the extruder idler, one for the x-idler and one for the y-idler)
* OPTIONAL 34x 3/8 washers (To go between your y-axis nuts and the printed parts)



From variable vitamins you need 2x *gt2 Pulley with 18-30 teeth*, and GT2 belts. The linear bearings are all *lm10uu* (10x) and smooth rods have diameter of 5/16in.
